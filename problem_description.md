# Data

The data uesed in this project comes from Comex Stat, a system for querying and extracting data from Brazilian foreign trade, which contains fetailed data on Brazilian exports and imports extracted monthly from SISCOMEX and based on the declaration of exporters and importers. 

The raw database is also available for download on the following [link] (https://www.gov.br/produtividade-e-comercio-exterior/pt-br/assuntos/comercio-exterior/estatisticas/base-de-dados-bruta). But as the primary objective of this project is to put the skills I learned into practice and also learn new skills, I decided to increase the difficulty and extract the data from [Comex Stat's website] (http://comexstat.mdic.gov.br/en/municipio) directly instead of using the raw database.
